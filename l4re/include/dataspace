/**
 * Interface for memory-like objects.
 *
 * Dataspaces are a central abstraction provided by L4Re. A dataspace is
 * an abstraction for any thing that is available via usual memory access
 * instructions. A dataspace can be a file, as well as the memory-mapped
 * registers of a device, or anonymous memory, such as a heap.
 *
 * The dataspace interface defines a set of methods that allow any kind
 * of dataspace to be attached (mapped) to the virtual address space of
 * an L4 task and then be accessed via memory-access instructions.
 * The L4Re::Rm interface can be used to attach a dataspace to a
 * virtual address space of a task paged by a certain instance of a region map.
