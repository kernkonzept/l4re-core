   * This function should never block. It should immediately return as much
   * entropy as is available. If the call returns less than the requested
   * bytes and a notification interrupt was installed, then the service triggers
   * an interrupt as soon as the remaining entropy is available. That means
   * that when an interrupt is triggered, the service must guarantee that the
   * next call to get_random() returns at least the number of missing bytes
   * for the call that initially triggered the notification.
   *
   * If get_random() is called while a notification is pending, then the
   * behaviour is implementation-defined.
