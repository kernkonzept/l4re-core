Tutorial lua script for Ned
===========================

Firstly we have a set of definitions available. Some come from 'ned.lua'
embedded script and others from the C++ bindings within Ned. The whole L4
functionality is in the lua module "L4" (use 'local L4 = require("L4");').
The L4 module classes and functions cope with L4 capabilities and
their invocations, provide a set of constants and access to the L4Re environment of
the running program.  Finally, of course it can also start L4 applications.

L4 Capabilities
===============

The L4 module defines a user data type for capabilities.  A capability in lua
carries a typed L4 capability and is accompanied with a set of type specific
methods that may be called on the object behind the capability.  There also
exists a way to cast a capability to a capability to a different type of
object using L4.cast(type, cap).

L4.cast(type, cap)

Returns a cap transformed to a capability of the given type, whereas type
is either the fully qualified C++ name of the class encapsulating the object
or the L4 protocol ID assigned to all L4Re and L4 system objects.
If the type is unknown then nil is returned.

Generic capabilities provide the following methods:

is_valid()

  Returns true if the capability is not the invalid cap (L4_INVALID_CAP), and
  false if it is the invalid cap.


L4Re::Namespace object
======================

There is a lua type for name spaces that has the following methods:

query(name), or q(name)

  Returns a closure (function) that initiates a query for the given name
  within the name space.  The function takes no arguments and returns
  a capability if successful or nil if name is not found.


link(name), or l(name)

  Returns a function that can create a link to the given object in the name
  space if put into another name space. The function takes two parameters
  the target name space and the name in the target name space.
  Loader:create_namespace and Loader.fill_namespace calls this function
  when things are really put into an L4Re::Namespace.


register(name, cap), or r(name, cap)

  Registers the given object capability under the given name. cap can
  be either a real capability (note query returns a function), a string, or
  nil.  If it is a capability it is just put into the name space.
  In the case cap is a string a placeholder will be put into the name space
  that will be replaced with a real capability later by some program.
  And if nil is use the name will be deleted from the name space.


L4::Factory object
==================

The factory object provides an interface to the generic create method of a
factory.

create(proto, ...)

  This method calls the factory to create an object of the given type,
  via the L4 protocol number (see L4.Proto table for more) all further
  arguments are passed to the factory.


Access to the L4Re Env capabilities
===================================

The L4 module defines a table L4.Env that contains the capabilities
of the L4Re::Env::env() environment. Namely:

factory      The kernel factory of Ned
log          The log object of Ned
user_factory The factory provided to Ned, including memory
parent       The parent of Ned
rm           The region map of Ned
scheduler    The scheduler of Ned


Some useful constants
=====================

L4.Proto table contains the most important protocol values for
L4 and L4Re objects.

  Namespace
  Goos
  Rm
  Irq
  Sigma0
  Factory
  Log
  Scheduler

The L4.Info table contains the following functions:

  Kip.str()    The banner string found in the kernel info page
  arch()       Architecture name, such as: x86, amd64, arm, ppc32
  platform()   Platform name, such as: pc, ux, realview, beagleboard
  mword_bits() Number of native machine word bits (32, 64)


Support for starting L4 programs
================================

The L4 module defines two classes that are useful for starting L4 applications.
The class L4.Loader that encapsulates a fairly high level policy
that is useful for starting a whole set of processes. And the class L4.App_env
that encapsulates a more fine-grained policy.

L4.Loader
---------

The class L4.Loader encapsulates the policy for starting programs with the
basic building blocks for the application coming from a dedicated loader,
such as Moe or a Loader instance. These building blocks are a region map (Rm),
a scheduler, a memory allocator, and a logging facility.
A L4.Loader object is typically used to start multiple applications. There
is a L4.default_loader instance of L4.Loader that uses the L4.Env.mem_alloc
factory of the current Ned instance to create the objects for a new program.
However you may also use a more restricted factory for applications and
instantiate a loader for them.  The L4.Loader objects can already be used
to start a program with L4.Loader:start(app_spec, cmd, ...). Where app_spec
is a table containing parameters for the new application. cmd is the
command to run and the remaining arguments are the command-line options for
the application.

]==]

L4.default_loader:start({}, "rom/hello");

local _doc = [==[

This statement does the following:
 1. Create a new environment for the application
 2. Add the rom name-space into the new environment (thus shares Ned's
    'rom' directory with the new program).
 3. Creates all the building blocks for the new process and starts the
    'l4re' support kernel in the new process which in turn starts 'rom/hello'
    in the new process.

Using the app_spec parameter you can modify the behavior in two ways. There are
two supported options 'caps' for providing more capabilities for the
application. And 'log' for modifying the logger tag and color.

]==]

local my_caps = {
  fb = L4.Env.vesa;
};

L4.default_loader:start({caps = my_caps, log = {"APP", "blue"}}, "rom/hello");

local _doc = [==[

This snippet creates a caps template (my_caps) and uses it for the
new process and also sets user-defined log tags.  The L4.Loader:start method,
however, automatically adds the 'rom' directory to the caps environment if
not already specified in the template.

Environment variables may be given as a table in the third argument to
start. Argument to the program are given space separated after the program
name within a single string.

]==]

L4.default_loader:start({}, "rom/program arg1 " .. arg2, { LD_DEBUG = 1 });

local _doc = [==[

L4.default_loader:startv is a variant of the start function that takes the
arguments of the program as a single argument each. If the last argument to
startv is a table it is interpreted as environment variables for the program.
The above example would translate to:

]==]

L4.default_loader:startv({}, "rom/program", "arg1", arg2, { LD_DEBUG = 1 });

local _doc = [==[

To create a new L4.Loader instance you may use a generic factory for all
building blocks or set individual factories.

]==]

l = L4.Loader.new({
  mem = L4.Env.user_factory:create(L4.Proto.Factory, 512*1024):m("rs")
});

local _doc = [==[

Creates a loader instance that uses the newly created 512 Kbyte factory for
all building blocks. To set individual factories use the options:
  'mem'       as memory allocator for the new processes and as
              default factory for all objects not explicitely set to a
              different factory
  'log_fab'   for creating log objects.
  'ns_fab'    for creating name-space objects.
  'rm_fab'    for creating region-map objects.



L4.App_env
----------

L4.App_env provides a more fine-grained control for a single process or for a
limited number of processes. L4.App_env uses an L4.Loader object as basic
facility. However you can override the memory allocator 'mem' for for the new
process as well as the kernel factory 'factory', the log capability etc.

]==]

local e = L4.App_env.new({
  loader = l,
  mem = L4.Env.user_factory:create(L4.Proto.Factory, 128*1024):m("rs")
});

e:start("rom/hello");
