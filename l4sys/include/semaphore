/**
 * Kernel-provided semaphore object.
 *
 * This is the interface for kernel-provided semaphore objects. The
 * object provides the classical functions `up()` and `down()` for
 * counting the semaphore and blocking.  The semaphore is a
 * Triggerable with respect to the `up()` function, this means that a
 * semaphore can be bound to an interrupt line at an ICU (L4::Icu) and
 * incoming interrupts increment the semaphore counter.
 *
 * The `down()` method decrements the semaphore counter and blocks
 * if the counter is already zero.  Blocking on a semaphore may---as all
 * blocking operations---either return sucessfully, or be aborted due to
 * an expired timeout provided to the `down()` operation, or due to an
 * L4::Thread::ex_regs() operation with the #L4_THREAD_EX_REGS_CANCEL
 * flag set.
 *
 * The main reason for using a semaphore instead of an L4::Irq is to ensure
 * that incoming trigger signals do not interfere with any open-wait
 * operations, as used for example in a server loop.
