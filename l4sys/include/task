   * \retval -L4_EINVAL  Invalid source task capability.
   * \retval -L4_IPC_SEMAPFAILED The map operation failed due to limited quota.
   *
   * This method allows for asynchronous transfer of capabilities, memory
   * mappings, and IO-port mappings (on IA32) from one task to another.
   * The destination task is the task referenced by the capability on which the
   * map is invoked, and the receive window is the whole address space of that
   * task. By specifying proper rights in the `snd_fpage` and `snd_base`, it is
   * possible to remove rights during transfer.
   *
   * \note If the send flex page is of type #L4_FPAGE_OBJ, the #L4_CAP_FPAGE_S
   *       right is removed from the transferred capability unless both the
   *       source and destination task capabilities possess the #L4_CAP_FPAGE_S
   *       right themselves.
   *
   * \note Even with l4_error() returning L4_EOK there might be cases where not
   *       all pages of the send flexpage were mapped respectively granted to
   *       the destination task, for instance, if the corresponding mapping in
   *       the destination task does already exist.

   * For more information on spaces and mappings, see
