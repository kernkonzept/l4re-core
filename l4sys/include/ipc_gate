/**
 * The C++ IPC gate interface.
 *
 * IPC gates are used to create secure communication channels between
 * protection domains. An IPC gate can be created using the L4::Factory
 * interface. L4::Ipc_gate::bind_thread() binds an L4::Thread as the receiver
 * of all messages to an IPC gate.
 *
 * The bind_thread() call allows to assign each IPC gate a kernel protected,
 * machine-word sized payload called a *label*. It securely identifies the
 * gate. The two least significant bits of the *label* are ORed with the
 * L4_CAP_FPAGE_S and L4_CAP_FPAGE_W bits stored in the capability when
 * transfered to the receiver. This means the *label* should usually have its
 * two least significant bits set to zero. The *label* is only visible in the
 * #L4::Task which is running the thread the IPC gate was bound to and cannot
 * be altered by the sender.
 *
 * \includefile{l4/sys/ipc_gate}
 *
 * For the C interface refer to the C \ref l4_kernel_object_gate_api.
