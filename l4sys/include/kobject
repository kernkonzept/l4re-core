 * This is the base class for all remote objects accessible using RPC.
 * However, subclasses doe not directly inherit from L4::Kobject but _must_
 * use L4::Kobject_t (L4::Kobject_0t, L4::Kobject_2t, L4::Kobject_3t,
 * or L4::Kobject_x) for inheritance, otherwise these classes cannot be used
 * as RPC interfaces.
 *
 * \attention Objects derived from Kobject *must* never add any data to
 *            those objects. Kobjects can act only as proxy object
 *            for encapsulating object invocations.
