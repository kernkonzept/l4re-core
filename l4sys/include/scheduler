   * the idle thread since its last reset. To calculate a load estimate `l` one
   * has to retrieve the idle time at the beginning (`i1`) and the end (`i2`)
   * of a known time interval `t`. The load is then calculated as
   * l = 1 - (i2 - i1)/t.
   *
   * The idle time is only defined for online CPUs. Reading the idle time from
   * offline CPUs is undefined and may result in either getting -L4_EINVAL or

   * \note The idle time statistics of remote CPUs is updated on context switch
   * events only, hence may not be up-to-date when requested cross-CPU.  To get
   * up-to-date idle time you should use a thread running on the same CPU of
