 *
 * A flexpage is a page with a variable size, that can describe memory,
 * IO-Ports (IA32 only), and sets of kernel objects.
 *
 * A flexpage describes an always size aligned region of an address space.
 * The size is given in a log2 scale. This means the size in elements (bytes
 * for memory, ports for IO-Ports, and capabilities for kernel objects) is
 * always a power of two.
 *
 * A flexpage also carries type and access right information for the
 * described region. The type information selects the address space in which
 * the flexpage is valid. Access rights have a meaning depending on the
 * specific address space (type).
 *
 * There exists a special type for defining \em receive \em windows or for
 * the l4_task_unmap() method, that can be used to describe all address
 * spaces (all types) with a single flexpage.
