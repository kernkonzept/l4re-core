   *      gate was not bound yet.
   *
   * The specified `label` is passed to the receiver of the incoming IPC. It is
   * possible to re-bind a receive endpoint to the same or a different thread.
   * In this case, IPC already in flight will be delivered with the old label
   * to the previously bound thread unless L4::Thread::modify_senders() is used
   * to change these labels.
