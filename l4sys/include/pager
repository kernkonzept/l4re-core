/**
 * Io_pager interface.
 *
 * \note This interface is IA32 specific.
 *
 * This class defines the interface for handling IO page faults. IO page
 * faults happen when a thread tries to access an IO port that it does not
 * currently have access to.
 *
 * Depending on the microkernel's implementation, IO page faults can be
 * handled in two ways.
 *
 * If the microkernel does not support IO page faults, this IO pagefault
 * interface is not used. Instead, the microkernel sends an exception IPC to
 * the thread's exception handler (L4::Exception), indicating a #GP (exception
 * number 13). The exception handler must consult the faulting instruction to
 * determine the cause of the exception. This is the default in Fiasco.OC.
 *
 * In contrast, if the microkernel supports IO page faults, the microkernel
 * will generate an IO page fault message and send it to the thread's page
 * fault handler (pager). The page fault handler can implement this interface
 * to handle the IO page faults.
 *
 * \note A program may use this mechanism to implement a lazy IO port access
 * scheme.
 *
 * \note The page fault and exception handlers are set with the
 * L4::Thread::control interface.
