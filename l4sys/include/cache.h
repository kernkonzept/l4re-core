 * \ingroup l4_api
 * Various functions for cache consistency.
 *
 * These functions shall be used to ensure that
 * - all blocks (e.g. CPU cores, devices, DMA engines) are guaranteed to see
 *   the same copy of a memory location (Point of Coherency -- PoC),
 * - instruction and data caches of a core are guaranteed to see the same copy
 *   of a memory location (Point of Unification -- PoU).
 *
 * Certain functions are NOPs on certain architectures, for example on Intel
 * it's not necessary to explicitly make caches coherent to PoU.
